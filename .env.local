# Sample .env.local file for Next.js with Clerk

# fal.ai API Key
FAL_AI_API_KEY=your_fal_ai_api_key_here

# Instructions:
# 1. Rename this file to .env.local and replace 'your_fal_ai_api_key_here' with your actual fal.ai API key.
# 2. Do not expose your API key in frontend code. Use environment variables securely by accessing them in server-side code.
# 3. For client-side calls, consider using API routes in Next.js to keep your keys secure.
